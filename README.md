# ALGORITHM AND DATA STRUCTURE
---------------------------------------------
LINEAR SEARCH - unsorted data
- Search by going one by one through element
//indexOf() includes()  find  find
BEST -> O(1) - Constant Best Case
WORST -> O(n) -looking through million integers. will have to look million times
AVG -> O(n) - middle is also avg times
---------------------------------------------
BINARY SEARCH - sorted data
// eliminates half data, divide and conquer
// length of array grows, how does time complexity grows
BEST CASE - O(1)
WORST AVERAGE - O(log n)
---------------------------------------------
NAIVE SEARCH
// Substring

---------------------------------------------
SORT
// sorting smaller to bigger, alphabetically, based on year...
